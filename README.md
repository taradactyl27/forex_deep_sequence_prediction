# Forex Data Prediction via Recurrent Neural Network Deep Sequence Modeling

## Research Paper
Our research paper can be viewed [here](https://github.com/taradactyl27/forex_deep_sequence_prediction/blob/main/paper/Forex_Prediction_via_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Deep_Sequence_Modeling.pdf)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository 
    
    `git clone git@github.com:taradactyl27/forex_deep_sequence_prediction.git`

2. All code is located within the DeepSequenceModelingPricePrediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. This can be viewed within Google Colab, VS Code, or whichever way is most convenient for you.

## Requirements

1. Compiling price data from Polygon requires a Polygon API key which can be obtained through their website. This was the main source of our data and is necessary for replicating our results.  

2. We optionally have code to pull data from a MongoDB cluster which would require proper credentials if you plan to compile your own dataset using our code.
